# Machine Learning Examples
This repository is a collection of machine learning projects and code examples using a variety of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. It is intended to showcase the range the depth of my skills in machine learning programming with Python. Examples are given in both English and Spanish.

## About Me
Hello! My name is Katlyn Goeujon-Mackness, a Python developer and data scientist with experience in many facets of Python and popular libraries. I am most interested in machine learning algorithms and exploring the breadth of what libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn have to offer.

## Repository Structure
### 1. Regresión Regularizada con Ridge y Lasso (ES)
#### Regularlized Regression with Ridge and Lasso techniques.
Objective: Compare Ridge (L2) and Lasso (L1) regularlized regression techniques compared to multiple linear regression to find the best fit model for the data.

### 1. Máquina de vectores de soporte (ES)
#### Support vector machine 
Objective: Using SVM, compare different types of kernels to find the most accurate model in order to find out what may be associated with employees leaving a particular employee.
