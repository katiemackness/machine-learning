# Machine Learning Examples

Welcome to my collection of machine learning projects! This repository showcases various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. The goal is to demonstrate my expertise in machine learning programming using popular libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn.

**Note:** Most examples are provided in Spanish.

## About Me
Hello! I'm **Katlyn Goeujon-Mackness**, a Python developer and data scientist passionate about machine learning algorithms. I enjoy exploring the vast capabilities of Python and its powerful libraries.

## Repository Structure

Each notebook in this repository focuses on a different machine learning technique, with objectives clearly defined for each project:

- **Regresión Regularizada con Ridge y Lasso (ES)**  
  *Regularized Regression with Ridge and Lasso techniques*  
  Objective: Compare Ridge (L2) and Lasso (L1) regularized regression techniques with multiple linear regression to determine the best model fit.

- **Máquina de Vectores de Soporte (ES)**  
  *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*  
  Objective: Compare different kernel types in SVM to create the most accurate model for predicting employee attrition.

- **Árboles de Decisión (ES)**  
  *Decision Trees*  
  Objective: Evaluate various decision tree models using different criteria to predict the best medication for a patient based on test results.

- **Modelos Ensambles (ES)**  
  *Ensemble Models*  
  Objective: Compare Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and AdaBoost classifiers to determine the best model for predicting medication prescriptions.

- **Regresión Logística (ES)**  
  *Logistic Regression*  
  Objective: Compare multiple logistic regression models to predict the best medication recommendation for a patient.

- **Clustering Jerárquico (ES)**  
  *Hierarchical Clustering*  
  Objective: Utilize hierarchical clustering models and dendrograms to group customers and recommend products based on past purchases.

- **Clasificación K-Medias (ES)**  
  *K-Means Classification*  
  Objective: Apply K-Means classification methods to cluster flower records in the Iris dataset.
